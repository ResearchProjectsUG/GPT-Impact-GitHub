# Data Analysis: Dynamics of Software Development in South Asia

## Project Overview
The software development industries in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India have shown dynamic growth over the past decade. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of the trends, challenges, and opportunities within the software development sectors of these countries. Using data from various sources, including the GitHub Innovation Graph, the analysis will explore key metrics related to software activity, collaboration, and industry growth.

The report is structured as follows:
- **Data Collection**: Details on the datasets used for the analysis, including their sources and relevance to the software industry in each country.
- **Data Analysis**: An exploration of the key trends identified from the data, highlighting differences and similarities between the three countries.
- **Conclusions**: Insights drawn from the data analysis, with potential implications for the future of software development in the region.

## Data Collection

The data for this analysis is sourced from multiple publicly available datasets and repositories, primarily focusing on software development activity. The **GitHub Innovation Graph** is the primary source, providing structured data on developer activity aggregated by economy. Additional sources include government reports and industry publications from each country.
