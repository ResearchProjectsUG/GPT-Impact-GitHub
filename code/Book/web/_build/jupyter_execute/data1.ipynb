    "This graph shows the number of repositories per 100,000 inhabitants by country (India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka) from Q1 2020 to Q1 2024. The following key insights can be drawn from the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sri Lanka** leads in the number of repositories per 100k inhabitants, consistently staying ahead of both India and Bangladesh. By Q1 2024, Sri Lanka has exceeded 4,000 repositories per 100k inhabitants.\n",
    "- **India** shows steady growth, following closely behind Sri Lanka. India's repository creation per capita has surpassed 2,500 by Q1 2024, indicating the country's solid and growing developer base.\n",
    "- **Bangladesh**, while demonstrating growth, lags behind both Sri Lanka and India. By Q1 2024, Bangladesh reaches just over 1,000 repositories per 100k inhabitants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "- **Sri Lanka**'s higher number of repositories per 100k inhabitants suggests a highly active and engaged developer community relative to its population size. This could be due to a thriving tech startup ecosystem and active government support for digital initiatives.\n",
    "- **India** shows substantial growth in repository creation, reflecting the country's growing importance in the global software industry, though its per capita repository count remains lower than that of Sri Lanka.\n",
    "- **Bangladesh**'s lower repository creation rate indicates that while the tech industry is growing, it is still developing compared to its regional counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparative Insights:\n",
    "- The data highlights **Sri Lanka** as an outlier in terms of repository creation per capita. Despite being smaller in population, Sri Lanka outpaces India and Bangladesh significantly.\n",
    "- **India**, with its much larger population, has a lower number of repositories per capita but still shows impressive growth, reflecting the scale of its developer ecosystem.\n",
    "- **Bangladesh**, although trailing in repository creation, is showing consistent progress, suggesting that the country's software development sector is steadily maturing."
