    "### Analysis\n",
    "This graph represents the number of pushers per 100,000 inhabitants by programming language in Bangladesh, from Q1 2020 to Q1 2024. Key insights from the graph include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JavaScript** shows a steep increase in the number of pushers over time, rising from around 5 per 100k to approximately 17 per 100k, indicating its growing popularity in Bangladesh's developer community.\n",
    "- **Python** and **PHP** also display moderate growth, with Python being the most steadily increasing language in terms of usage among developers.\n",
    "- Languages like **C**, **C#**, and **C++** remain relatively low in terms of usage, showing minimal fluctuations during the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data indicates a strong preference for web development technologies, with JavaScript, PHP, and Python leading the way, while systems programming languages like C and C++ are less popular in Bangladesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "- **JavaScript** dominance can be attributed to its widespread use in web and mobile application development.\n",
    "- **Python**’s steady growth reflects its use in data science and machine learning projects, which are becoming more popular.\n",
    "- Other languages such as **Ruby**, **Go**, and **TypeScript** show little to no significant change, suggesting they have a niche but stable developer base."

    "\n",
    "- **JavaScript** shows the most significant increase over time, starting around 20 pushers per 100k and reaching nearly 70 pushers by Q1 2024. This indicates a robust and growing preference for JavaScript in Sri Lanka's software development ecosystem.\n",
    "- **PHP** and **Python** are also popular languages, with PHP showing more fluctuations, but both languages have maintained steady growth over the years.\n",
    "- Similar to the Bangladesh trend, **C**, **C#**, and **C++** remain less popular, with minimal changes in the number of pushers.\n",
    "- **Go** and **Ruby** have very little presence, maintaining a low and stable number of pushers per 100k, which suggests limited adoption in Sri Lanka.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "- The steep rise in **JavaScript** reflects Sri Lanka’s increased focus on web and mobile development, likely driven by a growing digital economy.\n",
    "- **PHP**'s fluctuations may point to its widespread but varying use in specific web development projects.\n",
    "- **Python**'s steady increase shows its ongoing use in data science and automation tasks, aligning with global trends in software development.\n",
    "- **C**, **C#**, and **C++** continue to be niche languages in Sri Lanka, focused perhaps on specific system-level applications or educational contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparative Analysis with Bangladesh:\n",
    "- Sri Lanka shows a more dramatic rise in **JavaScript** compared to Bangladesh, with a larger base of pushers per 100k.\n",
    "- **Python** and **PHP** have similar levels of growth in both countries, although Sri Lanka shows more fluctuations in **PHP** usage."

    "- **PHP** still holds importance for web-based projects, but it does not show as significant growth as JavaScript or Python.\n",
    "- The relatively flat growth in **C**, **C#**, and **C++** indicates that these languages are likely being used for specialized or legacy systems rather than driving innovation in the modern tech stack.\n",
